# EvCars-Database-Project
Welcome to the EvCars Database Project! This project is a comprehensive research and development initiative that encompasses database retrieval, development, and execution.
# Project Overview
We've established "EvCars," a company dedicated to enhancing the infrastructure of websites, specifically in a database format. Our primary objective is to harness data-driven technology to optimize online services for searching Electric Vehicle (EV) cars.

In today's digital age, web applications play a pivotal role in business operations. They facilitate customer communication, employee collaboration, secure data storage, and provide critical information to management. Our project aims to replicate and extend the functionalities of prominent car dealer websites like Cars.com while offering data extraction capabilities through simple SQL queries.

# Database Development
Our database development journey began with MySQL and later expanded to multiuser databases using AWS, MySQL, PHP, and XAMPP. These databases enable users to search, sort, filter, and retrieve information based on web requests. Additionally, the application server performs mathematical and statistical calculations on the data to support web queries.

# Business Rules and Requirements
We conducted SWOT analyses and created sitemaps to define business rules and requirements for various entities based on website features. Our project implements relationships such as 1:1, 1:M, and M:N to match the website's structure. Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) were created to visualize these relationships. Our entity tables cover a wide range of aspects, from brand and model to engine and battery.

# Conclusion
This project is an in-depth exploration of database development and optimization for an EV car platform. It underscores the importance of data-driven solutions in today's online environment. We've carefully designed and implemented tables and relationships to ensure efficiency and relevance in handling vast amounts of data.
